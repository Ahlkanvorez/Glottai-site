# Glottai-site
Learning dead languages can be particularly difficult, since, with no one to talk to, words are often learned as individual units (or even tables of forms) instead of in their natural context. This site aims to aid vocabulary acquisition by teaching word-forms in proper context, from a variety of quotes pulled directly from authentic Latin and classical Greek sentences written by real Romans and Greeks.

This is the front-end browser-app, written in AngularJS.

To enable the startup script, enter the following command:

> chmod +x startup.sh

To start the test server, enter the following command:

> ./startup.sh

#### Note:
The current version assumes a REST-Api available on localhost:3000 with endpoints for all the data needed in the app. That API is not implemented in this Repo.

### Note:
I have switched from AngularJS to ReactJS, and have started a new repository accordingly. Here is a link to the new repo: https://github.com/Ahlkanvorez/Glottai-site-react
